Notes:

1. The CPLD bin file ZS1100A.pof is used to program the Altera/Intel CPLD 5M160ZE64I5N on the board.
2. It can be programmed using the Quartus programmer from Altera/Intel using the USB Blaster cable.
3. A clone cable also works equally well with the Quartus Programmer, though not recommended.
4. There is a 10 pin SMD connector (pads) at the bottom side of the PCB which provides the access to the JTAG pins for programming
5. A cable from Tag Connect with the part number TC2050-IDC-NL is required to mate with the 10 pin connector.
6. The source code for the CPLD is not part of the open hardware initiative.
